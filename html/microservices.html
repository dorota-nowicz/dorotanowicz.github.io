                <p class="lead"> This project consisted of the development of several web applications to offer services focused on the management of water supply and sewage treatment.
                The applications allow among other functionalities:</p>

                  <ul >
                    <li class="lead">Receive and send data by the operators</li>
                    <li class="lead">Review the inventory of the work carried out by maintenance</li>
                    <li class="lead">Create parts associated with the control and maintenance of network elements</li>
                    <li class="lead">Generate alerts and warnings based on the measurements provided by the control devices</li>
                  </ul>  


                  
                  <p class="lead"> The collected information gives technicians the ability to quickly make smart decisions, optimise operator jobs, and minimise costs.</p>

                    <p class="lead">  It is worth mentioning that this Client has its own information systems and a centralised database where it stores data collected by its remote control.
                Integration with the applications is done through Open API (Swagger).
                OpenAPI is a selection of machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and displaying web services.</p>

                <hr class="my-4">
               <p class="my-4"> Swagger is a set of concrete tools to work with the OpenAPI format.
                Making the applications to access some values of the Client database,
                a swagger.json file is generated, which is used to generate a client whose objective is to respond to the requests of our applications and
                thus guarantee the connection with the external database.</p>
